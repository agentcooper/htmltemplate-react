### htmltemplate-react

Experiment to provide a subset of [HTML::Template](http://search.cpan.org/~samtregar/HTML-Template-2.6/Template.pm)-like tag system powered by React components.

This proof of concept. You probably don't want to use on a new project.

#### Example

[Example](example/index.js)

```bash
npm install

cd example
webpack
open index.html
```
